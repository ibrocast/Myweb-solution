# Web Service with Web API demo
===


## This is a follow up coding assesment 
---

**This coding assesment is to demostrate building a Web Service with Web API to render data that can be consume by client** 

Technology used

* IDE visual studio 2013
* Entity FrameWork
* Nuget packages

First I create a database and  show more than one table and the relationship between those tables, then I created an API using Microsoft's Web API.



To run the application 
host on IIS Express using visual studio 2013   
and lunch the solution. On the web browser navigate to http://localhost:portNumber/api/order      
or it can be interact using Chrome's Postman GET command
